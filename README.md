# A UI development project for a music-lessons website in England, https://scottsbasslessons.com/.

The code is deployed here: http://stoicheff.com/test/scottsbass/

This was built as a minimalistic way to display lesson tiles with images, lesson titles and links, given data coming from a REST endpoint. 

For the layout, I'm using CSS flexbox. 

For the dynamic components, I'm using just web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) - elements of Web Components (HTML templates) and vanilla JavaScript.
